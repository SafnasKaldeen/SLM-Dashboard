# 10 Complex Battery Swapping Business Intelligence Questions

## 1. Multi-Dimensional Profitability Analysis with Operational Efficiency

**"What is the correlation between station-level electricity efficiency (distance per kWh), battery health degradation rates, and net profitability by location, segmented by customer usage patterns and seasonal variations over the last 18 months?"**

_Complexity: Combines revenue (FACT_PAYMENT), operational costs (FACT_EXPENSES), telemetry data (FACT_VEHICLE_TELEMETRY), distance tracking (FACT_VEHICLE_DISTANCE), and requires time-series analysis with multiple aggregation levels._

## 2. Customer Lifecycle Value with Predictive Battery Health

**"For customers who have owned vehicles for more than 12 months, calculate their total lifetime value including swap frequency, payment success rates, and correlate this with the battery degradation patterns (SOH decline rate) of their associated vehicles, identifying high-value customers whose battery usage suggests optimal maintenance scheduling."**

_Complexity: Requires joining customer ownership history (FACT_VEHICLE_OWNER), payment patterns, telemetry data, and time-based calculations for degradation trends._

## 3. Dealer Performance vs Regional Market Penetration

**"Analyze dealer performance by calculating conversion rates (vehicles sold to active swap customers), average customer lifetime value per dealer, operational efficiency of their associated swapping stations, and correlate this with geographic market penetration using location-based clustering of customer addresses and station proximity."**

_Complexity: Multi-table joins across dealer, customer, vehicle, station, and payment data with geographic analysis and performance metrics._

## 4. Battery Supply Chain Optimization with Usage Intelligence

**"Identify battery types with the highest utilization efficiency by analyzing charge cycle consumption rates, temperature exposure patterns, distance-to-degradation ratios, and cross-reference with station inventory turnover and customer demand patterns to optimize battery procurement and distribution strategy."**

_Complexity: Combines battery master data, telemetry patterns, station operations, and requires advanced analytics on usage optimization._

## 5. Fraud Detection and Payment Anomaly Analysis

**"Detect potential payment fraud or system abuse by identifying customers with unusual patterns: multiple failed payment attempts followed by successful wallet transactions, vehicles with telemetry gaps during high-value transaction periods, or customers whose vehicle usage patterns don't match their payment frequencies, segmented by dealer origination."**

_Complexity: Requires anomaly detection across payment, telemetry, and behavioral data with pattern recognition algorithms._

## 6. Predictive Maintenance with Revenue Impact

**"For vehicles showing early signs of battery health deterioration (SOH decline >2% per month), motor temperature anomalies, or frequent inverter errors, calculate the potential revenue impact on affected customers, identify optimal intervention timing to minimize service disruption, and estimate the cost-benefit of proactive vs reactive maintenance strategies."**

_Complexity: Predictive analytics combining telemetry diagnostics, customer revenue data, and maintenance cost modeling._

## 7. Network Optimization with Customer Journey Analysis

**"Analyze customer journey patterns by tracking GPS movement data to identify optimal locations for new swapping stations based on travel corridors, current station utilization rates, customer density heat maps, and projected revenue potential, while considering existing station cannibalization effects and dealer territory constraints."**

_Complexity: Geospatial analysis combining GPS tracking, station performance, customer demographics, and market expansion modeling._

## 8. Dynamic Pricing Strategy with Real-Time Utilization

**"Develop a dynamic pricing model by analyzing real-time station utilization (swap frequency by hour/day), battery inventory levels, electricity cost fluctuations, customer price sensitivity (based on payment success rates at different charge amounts), and seasonal demand patterns to optimize revenue while maintaining customer satisfaction."**

_Complexity: Real-time analytics combining operational data, financial metrics, and customer behavior with pricing optimization._

## 9. Fleet Health Scoring with Business Impact Assessment

**"Create a comprehensive fleet health score combining vehicle telemetry (battery health, motor performance, error frequencies), usage intensity (distance patterns, session frequency), maintenance history, and customer satisfaction indicators (payment success rates, complaint patterns), then correlate fleet health segments with business metrics like customer retention, revenue per vehicle, and operational costs."**

_Complexity: Multi-dimensional scoring algorithm combining technical, operational, and business metrics with predictive modeling._

## 10. Ecosystem Performance Optimization with Stakeholder Impact

**"Perform a comprehensive ecosystem analysis identifying the interdependencies between dealer performance (sales conversion, customer quality), station operational efficiency (uptime, maintenance costs, electricity usage), customer behavior patterns (usage frequency, payment reliability, geographic mobility), and battery lifecycle management (procurement timing, retirement strategies, recycling value) to optimize the entire business ecosystem ROI."**

_Complexity: Systems-level analysis requiring integration of all data sources with multi-stakeholder impact assessment and optimization modeling._
