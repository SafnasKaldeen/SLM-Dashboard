---

## Financial Calculations

### Current State (Per-Swap Pricing)

- **Average Usage:** 2 swaps/week (based on EDA)
- **Current Price per Swap:** Rs 250
- **Cost per Swap:** Rs 200
- **Net Profit per Swap:** Rs 50
- **Weekly Revenue per Customer:** 2 × Rs 250 = Rs 500
- **Weekly Profit per Customer:** 2 × Rs 50 = Rs 100
- **Weekly Revenue by Quantity:** Rs 500 (2 swaps × Rs 250)

### New Package Scenario

#### Package Economics

- **Package Price:** Rs 1,100/week
- **Price per Swap:** Rs 1,100 ÷ 5 = Rs 220/swap
- **Cost per Swap:** Rs 200
- **Net Profit per Swap:** Rs 220 - Rs 200 = Rs 20

#### Scenario A: Customer Uses All 5 Swaps (Worst Case)

- **Weekly Revenue:** Rs 1,100
- **Revenue by Quantity:** Rs 1,100 (5 swaps × Rs 220 effective price)
- **Weekly Cost:** 5 × Rs 200 = Rs 1,000
- **Weekly Profit:** Rs 1,100 - Rs 1,000 = Rs 100
- **Profit Change:** Rs 100 - Rs 100 = **Rs 0 (no change)**
- **Revenue Change:** Rs 1,100 - Rs 500 = **+Rs 600 (120% increase)**

#### Scenario B: Customer Uses Only 2 Swaps (Most Likely - Current Behavior)

- **Weekly Revenue:** Rs 1,100
- **Revenue by Quantity:** Rs 1,100 (prepaid, regardless of usage)
- **Weekly Cost:** 2 × Rs 200 = Rs 400
- **Weekly Profit:** Rs 1,100 - Rs 400 = Rs 700
- **Profit Change:** Rs 700 - Rs 100 = **+Rs 600 (600% increase)**
- **Revenue Change:** Rs 1,100 - Rs 500 = **+Rs 600 (120% increase)**

#### Scenario C: Customer Uses 3 Swaps (Moderate Increase)

- **Weekly Revenue:** Rs 1,100
- **Revenue by Quantity:** Rs 1,100 (prepaid)
- **Weekly Cost:** 3 × Rs 200 = Rs 600
- **Weekly Profit:** Rs 1,100 - Rs 600 = Rs 500
- **Profit Change:** Rs 500 - Rs 100 = **+Rs 400 (400% increase)**
- **Revenue Change:** Rs 1,100 - Rs 500 = **+Rs 600 (120% increase)**

#### Scenario D: Customer Uses 4 Swaps

- **Weekly Revenue:** Rs 1,100
- **Revenue by Quantity:** Rs 1,100 (prepaid)
- **Weekly Cost:** 4 × Rs 200 = Rs 800
- **Weekly Profit:** Rs 1,100 - Rs 800 = Rs 300
- **Profit Change:** Rs 300 - Rs 100 = **+Rs 200 (200% increase)**
- **Revenue Change:** Rs 1,100 - Rs 500 = **+Rs 600 (120% increase)**

---

## Break-Even Analysis

**Break-even point:** Customer must use 5 swaps/week for profit to match current state

**Calculation:**

- Current profit = Rs 100
- Package profit = Rs 1,100 - (n × Rs 200)
- Break-even: Rs 1,100 - (n × Rs 200) = Rs 100
- n = 5 swaps

**Critical Finding:** Even if customers use ALL 5 swaps, profit remains at Rs 100 (same as current)

**If customers use <5 swaps:** Pure profit increase from unused capacity

### Assuming 1,000 Active Customers

| Usage Level | % of Customers | Swaps/Week   | Revenue/Customer | Profit/Customer | Total Weekly Revenue | Total Weekly Profit |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Low (2)     | 70%            | 2            | Rs 1,100         | Rs 700          | Rs 770,000           | Rs 490,000          |
| Medium (3)  | 15%            | 3            | Rs 1,100         | Rs 500          | Rs 165,000           | Rs 75,000           |

| Max (5)     | 5%             | 5            | Rs 1,100         | Rs 100          | Rs 55,000            | Rs 5,000            |
| **TOTAL**   | **100%**       | **2.65 avg** | -                | -               | **Rs 1,100,000**     | **Rs 600,000**      |

**Current State (1,000 customers):**

- **Total Weekly Revenue:** 1,000 × Rs 500 = Rs 500,000
- **Total Weekly Profit:** 1,000 × Rs 100 = Rs 100,000

**New Package Impact:**

- **Revenue Increase:** Rs 1,100,000 - Rs 500,000 = **+Rs 600,000 (120% increase)**
- **Profit Increase:** Rs 600,000 - Rs 100,000 = **+Rs 500,000 (500% increase)**

---

## Revenue by Quantity Analysis

### Current Model (Pay-Per-Use)

- **Revenue directly tied to usage**
- 2 swaps = Rs 500 revenue
- 5 swaps = Rs 1,250 revenue
- **Revenue fluctuates with customer behavior**

### New Package Model (Prepaid Bundle)

- **Revenue fixed at Rs 1,100 regardless of usage**
- 2 swaps = Rs 1,100 revenue (Rs 600 more than current)
- 5 swaps = Rs 1,100 revenue (Rs 150 less than current pay-per-use)
- **Revenue guaranteed upfront, decoupled from actual usage**

### Revenue Stability Benefit

- **Predictable cash flow:** Rs 1,100 per customer weekly, guaranteed
- **No revenue loss from low-usage weeks**
- **Eliminates transaction friction** (no per-swap payments)

---

## Key Strategic Insights

### This Package is Financially Robust Because:

1. **Zero Downside Risk**

   - Even if ALL customers use all 5 swaps, profit remains at Rs 100 (current level)
   - Any usage below 5 swaps generates additional profit

2. **Massive Upside Potential**

   - If behavior remains at 2 swaps/week: **+600% profit per customer**
   - Based on EDA showing 2 swaps max for most customers

3. **Revenue Guarantee**

   - Rs 1,100 locked in per customer regardless of usage
   - 120% revenue increase even in worst-case scenario

4. **Non-Rollover Policy**
   - Unused swaps expire weekly
   - No accumulation of liabilities
   - Protects against future revenue dilution

### The Core Strategy

**You're betting:** Customers will overestimate their usage needs and prepay for 5 swaps while only using 2-3.

**This works because:**

- Customers perceive value in "bulk discount" (Rs 220/swap vs Rs 250/swap)
- Loss aversion makes them buy the package "just in case"
- EDA confirms actual usage stays low

**Risk mitigation:**

- Even if your bet fails and they use all 5 swaps, you don't lose money
- You maintain current profit levels in worst case

---

## Potential Concerns

### Customer Satisfaction

- **Perception of value:** Are customers happy paying Rs 1,100 but only using Rs 400-Rs 600 worth?
- **Buyer's remorse:** Do they feel "tricked" after realizing they wasted money?

### Competitive Risk

- Competitor offers flexible 2-swap package at Rs 450/week
- Your customers switch, seeing better value alignment

### Market Positioning

- Does this shift brand perception from "flexible service" to "aggressive upsell"?

---

## Recommendation

### This Package Works IF You:

1. ✅ Accept that it profits primarily from customer overestimation
2. ✅ Monitor churn rates closely in first 3 months
3. ✅ Offer a "right-sized" alternative (e.g., 3-swap package at Rs 700)
4. ✅ Communicate value clearly to avoid perception of deception

### Financial Verdict

**From pure revenue/profit perspective:** This is a low-risk, high-reward strategy.

**Revenue by Quantity multiplier:** Guaranteed 120% revenue increase regardless of usage patterns.

- **Revenue Change:** Rs 750 - Rs 500 = **+Rs 250 (50% increase)**

---

## Break-Even Analysis

**Break-even point:** Customer must use ≤3.25 swaps/week for increased profit

**Calculation:**

- Current profit = Rs 100
- Package profit = Rs 750 - (n × Rs 200)
- Break-even: Rs 750 - (n × Rs 200) = Rs 100
- n = 3.25 swaps

**Finding:** Package is profitable at all realistic usage levels (1-3 swaps)

**If customers use exactly 3 swaps:** Still +50% profit vs current

### Competitive Positioning

- Competitor could match or undercut at Rs 700/week
- Less differentiation than 5-swap "premium" package

### Revenue Ceiling

- Lower maximum revenue (Rs 750 vs Rs 1,100)
- More conservative growth trajectory

## Recommendation

### This Package Works IF You:

1. ✅ Want a lower-risk, sustainable profit increase

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ │
│ BASIC PLUS ⭐ PREMIUM 🏆 │
│ 2 swaps/week 3 swaps/week 5 swaps/week │

   - Capture middle market with Rs 750
   - Still get premium customers at Rs 1,100

### Expected Distribution (1,000 Customers)

| Tier      | % Adoption | Customers | Avg Swaps | Profit/Customer | Total Weekly Profit |
